# 🎯 SIMPLE STEPS TO TEST

## Step 1: Run the App

Double-click this file:
```
C:\programing projects\python\RUN_WITH_CONSOLE.bat
```

A black window will open - **keep it open!**

---

## Step 2: Try to Save

1. The app opens
2. Load your points file
3. Click "Save As"
4. Try to save to: `C:\Users\[YOUR_NAME]\Documents\test.prcl`
5. Click Save

**It will probably still fail - that's OK!**

---

## Step 3: Look at the Black Window

The black console window will show lots of text like:

```
[Save] ========== START SAVE REQUEST ==========
[Save] Project name: ...
[Save] Raw file path from frontend: 'C:\Users\...'
```

**Take a screenshot of ALL the text in that window!**

---

## Step 4: Send Me

**Send me the screenshot** and I'll fix it immediately!

---

## 🔥 Quick Questions:

1. **Is your Desktop synced with OneDrive?** (Check if you see "OneDrive" in the path)
2. **Does your path contain Arabic characters?** (like: رام اللة)

If YES to either - that's probably the problem!

**Temporary Fix:** Save to `C:\Documents\test.prcl` instead.

---

## That's It!

Just:
1. Run the bat file
2. Try to save
3. Screenshot the console
4. Send me

I'll fix it right away!
